# zeronet-redirect.xpi
This ZeroNet redirection extension is designed to provide a seamless browsing experience when you are navigating ZeroNet domains. The extension works by detecting when you are trying to access a ZeroNet domain with one of the following TLDs: .bit, .yo, .yu, .of, .inf, .zn, or .list. Once such a request is made, the extension automatically redirects your request to your local ZeroNet instance (http://127.0.0.1:43110/).

ZeroNet is an open, decentralized network that uses Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology to create a network resistant to censorship. In ZeroNet, instead of accessing centralized servers, websites are served by peers. This extension aims to improve your ZeroNet browsing experience by making the navigation process easier and more intuitive.

This extension is primarily useful for users who have a local ZeroNet instance running and want to access ZeroNet sites in a manner similar to how traditional websites are accessed. It masks the local ZeroNet instance URL and provides a straightforward way of accessing ZeroNet sites by entering the ZeroNet domain into the browser's address bar. Note that to use this extension, you must have ZeroNet running locally, as it does not provide ZeroNet capabilities by itself.

To utilize this extension, simply enter the desired ZeroNet domain into your browser's address bar. The extension will take care of the rest, automatically redirecting you to the corresponding site on your local ZeroNet instance.

Please note that for security reasons, extensions cannot register new protocols like "zero://". Hence, this extension only supports redirection from "http://" or no protocol prefix.

With this extension, you can easily navigate the ZeroNet universe using familiar domain-style addresses. Experience the freedom of decentralized internet today with the ZeroNet Redirect extension.
